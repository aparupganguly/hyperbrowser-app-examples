QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Create questions that users would realistically ask about this content
- Make answers comprehensive but concise (2-4 sentences ideal)
- Focus on actionable, factual, or educational information
- Avoid overly specific details that won't generalize well
- Ensure the answer can stand alone without referencing "the text" or "this document"

QUESTION TYPES TO PRIORITIZE:
- How-to questions ("How do I...", "How can I...")
- What-is questions ("What is...", "What does... mean?")
- Why questions ("Why should...", "Why does...")
- Troubleshooting ("What if...", "How to fix...")
- Best practices ("What's the best way to...")
